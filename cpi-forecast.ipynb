    "You have now learned to decompose a time series into seasonal and trend components and to use time series to forecast into the future using statsmodels. In this activity, your goal is to identify a new (to you) time series dataset and build a forecast using a seasonal and trend additive or multiplicative model using statsmodels.\n",

    "Summarize your findings in an executive brief that explores the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data description: Provide a high-level overview of your data and its timeframe along with general information on your dataset\n",
    "- Forecast: Give a description of the forecast. Describe the period that was projected and what the forecast implies about your data. Be sure to include presentation-ready plots with appropriate labels and titles.\n",
    "- Uncertainty: Discuss the evaluation of your model on testing data, and explore the residuals. Discuss the consequence of this error for your model and forecasts. Is there still structure to uncover?"
